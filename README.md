# TRAME — Milan Jewish Places (Time Map)

This repository contains an interactive time-enabled map centered on **Milan** to explore changes over time in places related to **Jewish life in Milan** (religious, educational, associations, community services, and other categories).

The map is built with **Leaflet** and a **time slider** (Leaflet.TimeDimension). Places appear/disappear according to their start/end dates. A category panel allows comparing multiple categories at the same time.
